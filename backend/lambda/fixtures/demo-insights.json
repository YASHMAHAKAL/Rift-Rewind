    "title": "The Comeback King of Season 2024",
    "story": "Your season told the story of resilience and adaptation. Starting the year with a rough 45% win rate on tanks, you discovered your true calling in the bot lane. By mid-season, your Jinx mechanics had evolved from 'respectable' to 'terrifying,' with a signature late-game power spike that turned 15 losses into comeback victories. Your teammates learned to trust the '20-minute Jinx insurance policy.' The data reveals a player who transforms defeats into lessons—your average CS/min jumped from 5.8 to 7.1 over 6 months. This wasn't luck; this was deliberate mastery.",
